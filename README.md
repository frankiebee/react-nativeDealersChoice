# react-nativeDealersChoice

Dealer's Choice is an Iphone app for the indecisive. Users can look at a bar's menu, or work through a decision tree to find their favorite drink.
Reviews and rating for each drink are tracked and displayed.

This repo is specifically for the Native IOS frontend. The server side Ruby on Rails code is located [here](https://github.com/IanThorp/DealersChoice)
